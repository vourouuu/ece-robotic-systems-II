# ECE - Robotic Systems II
This course, taught by Associate Professor Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis, is part of the 9th semester curriculum at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras.
Throughout the semester, we were assigned four practical exercises, which I have included in this Git repository.
